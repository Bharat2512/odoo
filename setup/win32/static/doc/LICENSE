This program cannot be distributed at all until the
LICENSE terms are clearly decided and assigned to
all addons.

Part of it (basically the addons that were part of Odoo 8.0)
will be licensed under LGPLv3 and form the Odoo Community
Edition.

Some of the new addons will be licensed under a proprietary
license linked to the purchase of an Odoo Enterprise
subscription. These modules, added to the Odoo Community
Edition, will form the Odoo Enterprise Edition.

This program cannot be distributed at all until the
